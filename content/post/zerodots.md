`ZER0D0TS` is my username on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZER0D0TS "ZER0D0TS") and an old WordPress blog I never really used. May it rest in peace. This blog on the other hand I shall keep alive with a slow drip of posts and curious projects... the first of which, shall be the infamous ***how I set up this blog*** post!

For now, this [hugo markdown cheatsheet](/page/hugo-markdown-cheatsheet) is a taster of the sort of things I'm going to do to make blogging easier for myself.
